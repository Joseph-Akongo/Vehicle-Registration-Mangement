Vehicle Registration Management System

The Vehicle Registration Management System is a C# application designed to manage vehicle registration plates using a Windows Forms interface. This system allows users to perform various operations such as adding, editing, searching, and deleting registration plates, as well as saving and loading data from text files.

Key Features:

User Interface: The application features a user-friendly interface built using Windows Forms technology, providing easy navigation and interaction for users.

Plate Management: Users can add new registration plates to the system by entering plate information into a text box and clicking the "Enter" button. They can also edit existing plates, delete plates, and search for specific plates using both binary search and linear search algorithms.

File Handling: The system supports loading and saving data to text files. Users can open pre-saved text files containing registration plate data, and changes made during the session are automatically saved upon closing the application.

Plate Tagging: Users can tag selected registration plates with an additional character value, denoted by "z" prefixing the plate. This feature provides a way to mark and distinguish specific plates within the system.

Sorting: The system automatically sorts the list of registration plates alphabetically after each operation that modifies the list, ensuring consistency and ease of access.

How to Use:

Adding Plates: Enter a registration plate into the text box and click "Enter" to add it to the system. Ensure that the plate format follows the specified conventions (e.g., "1GTF-234").

Editing Plates: Select a plate from the list, make the necessary changes in the text box, and click the "Edit" button to update the plate information.

Deleting Plates: Select a plate from the list and click the "Delete" button to remove it from the system.

Searching Plates: Enter a plate number into the text box and click either the "Binary Search" or "Linear Search" button to find the plate within the system.

Tagging Plates: Select a plate from the list and click the "Tag" button to mark it with a "z" prefix. This action helps identify and differentiate specific plates.

File Operations: Use the "Open" button to load registration plate data from a text file, and the "Save" button to save the current data to a text file. The system automatically handles file naming and storage.
